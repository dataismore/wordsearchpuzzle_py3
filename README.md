word-search-puzzle-generator-python3

This is a work-in-progress to create a simple wordsearch generator in python 3.

1. Create a puzzle grid (width, height)
2. Set how much of the grid should be taken up by the words.
2. Read from a list of words (n_words.txt) based on setp 2.
3. Set probability of having the word in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal arrangement.
4. Create the puzzle
